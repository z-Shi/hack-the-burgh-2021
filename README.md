## Hack the Burgh 2021

This repository will be used to store my team's submission for our chosen challenge in the Hack the Burgh Hackathon.

# Challenge
We selected the BlackRock challenge which was to "come up with ideas to help individuals understand the fundamentals of investing, thereby improving financial education and inclusion".

# Project Overview
Our project is a single-page react app that allows the user to enter their investment goal & budget and it displays some relevant information.
It was made with the intention that no login is required, it simply serves information, being easy to use with little-to-no distractions on screen.
A GitHub action has been created, so once committed, the site is hosted on Google Cloud.

# Usage
To use the site, simply load the link you have (only available during submission period).

# Technology Used
- React
- Google Cloud
